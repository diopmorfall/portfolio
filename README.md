## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first development
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to build a website with the mobile-first workflow and how to apply the knowledge I studied upfront (Flexbox, JavaScript)

### Continued development

This project is based on the first version I built two years ago, so I just fixed some issues in it redesigned some parts of it.
What's sure is that I'll continue to update the site with the new projects that I'm going to build.
