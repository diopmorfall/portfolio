## Overview

### Guidelines

The portfolio must include:

- A bio where we describe ourselves
- Our photo and/or a photo of our projects
- Links to our social profiles
- Links to our projects (if we have any)
- Link to our GitHub profile
- A showcase of our skills
- An easy medium for contact


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Github Pages](https://diopmorfall.github.io/four-card-feature-section-master/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned for the first time how to build a website and how to apply the knowledge I studied upfront (Flexbox, JavaScript, )

### Continued development

This first project isn't fully responsive and has some other issues: I'm going to design a new version of this site but I don't want to delete the old one, because I want to compare it  with the new portfolio once it'll be finished.

### Useful resources

- [Interneting is hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/) - This helped me understand basic HTML and CSS in a clear way.
